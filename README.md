600 sq ft @ 4k for 3 months 
Most have wifi 
Dry town but you are allowed to have wine in a cup 
Burning money - every tent is rented, not owned, with high-rollers investing (can we even call it that?) over $80k in rennovations to property they can't technically increase the value of because they are renting it from [ still unclear ]
