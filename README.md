Dry town but you are allowed to have wine in a cup 
Did you smell that? It's burning $ - every tent is rented, not owned

# Beg for permission, ask for forgiveness - the rules 
Rule #1 is 'must abide by the rules' 
'as long as they abide by the rules and stay active in religious instruction, they will be welcomed back each year. And if one of their sons is wants to be involved with the community, he will likely skip the waiting list and be granted a “generational hand-off”'

# Chapter 4: Notes from the Peanut Gallery 
The barn next door can hold 7000 people 

# Questions 
Who owns this land? Who is it rented from
