# Chapter 1: History 
Back in 1870 there were 200 tents, but in the nature of * insert something clever, I'm blanking, this is such a cop-out * there are 114 around the Great Auditorium -- an auditorium so great, it can allegely hold up to 7000 people with aucoustics rumored to be better than carnegie hall but the jury is still out on that one. 


# Chapter 2: The Fundamentals - for the sake of the cheese-pizza-ers in the room. 
- 600 sq ft @ 6k for 3 months 
- Most have wifi 
- Dry town but you are allowed to have wine in a cup 
- Did you smell that? It's burning $ - every tent is rented, not owned

# Chapter 3: #RushTentCity 
- Like any other tent city, there is an intensive interview process to join - this is done through an organization that has a webiste with such poor UX, I can't even continue to attempt to navigate through it, I have no more info here sorry 
- 10 year+ waitlist to rent - but if you are a long-term renter and your family particpates in relegious acitivies (camp leader, beach badge checker), you can Disney-world-fast-pass it a few years up the line, called a generational hand-off. If you are good at dancing to foo fighters screamo in the sand that also counts towards your mojo score. etc etc the list goes on.
